# SV_testbench_generator01

This is a Python script that generates a simple testbench automatically. It takes two input files: a SystemVerilog design file (DUT) and a test scenario file for deterministic test cases. The output is a testbench file that can be used to verify the correctness of the design requirements. With this script, you can quickly generate testbenches without having to manually write all the code.
